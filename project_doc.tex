Project Description: We are creating a 2 player game to simulate a game of badminton. We plan to have 2 players, who move left and right on opposite sides of a net to hit a birdie back and forth. We also want to include overhand and underhand hitting for the players. They can also jump. 

Current Functionalities:
* Player 1 created
* The gym/field is created
* A net prevents further movement of Player1
* Player1 can move left and right, jump
* Player1 has a walk animation
* Created a Birdie
* Player2 created
* Player2 can move left and right, jump
* Player2 has a walk animation
* Hit animation created for Player1 and Player2
* Player1 and Player2 can now move left and right in the middle of jumps
* Rackets created
* Birdie can rotate mid-air
* Racket has hit detection 


Planned Functionalities: 
* Add underhand hit animation
* Perfect the birdie physics
* Fully test hit animations for rackets
